## Overview
This room introduces the basics of cybersecurity, including the main types of cyber threats, common vulnerabilities, and the mindset required to understand and protect systems. It sets the foundation for further learning in red and purple team activities.

---

## Key Concepts Learned
- The definition of cybersecurity and its importance  
- Types of threats: malware, phishing, social engineering  
- Common vulnerabilities and attack vectors  
- Basics of ethical hacking and penetration testing  
- The difference between red team (offense) and blue/purple team (defense)

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Virtual lab environment (provided by TryHackMe)  
- Browser-based exercises  
- Basic Linux commands (introduced in room exercises)  

> Focus on learning outcomes, not step-by-step answers or flags.

---

## What I Found Challenging
Reflect on anything that was new or confusing, e.g.:  
> Understanding the variety of attack types was overwhelming at first, but organizing them by category helped me grasp the concepts.

---

## Security Takeaways
- Even simple misconfigurations can lead to security breaches  
- Awareness of threats is the first step in defending systems  
- Ethical hacking must always follow legal and educational guidelines

---

## Detection & Defense Thoughts (Purple Team)
- Monitoring for phishing attempts or malware activity is critical  
- User training and awareness programs help reduce human error  
- Implementing basic defenses (firewalls, antivirus, logging) mitigates simple attacks

---

## Reflection
This room gave me a structured introduction to cybersecurity concepts. It reinforced the importance of foundational knowledge before attempting practical labs and helped me start thinking like both an attacker (red team) and a defender (purple team).
